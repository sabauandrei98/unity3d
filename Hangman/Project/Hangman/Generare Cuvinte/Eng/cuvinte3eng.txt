Persuasion is often more effectual than force
United we stand divided we fall
Wit is educated insolence
One swallow does not make the spring
We are what we repeatedly do
Behind every great fortune there is a crime
Glory is fleeting but obscurity is forever
Very few of us are what we seem
The price of greatness is responsibility
Everything has beauty but not everyone sees it
Respect yourself and others will respect you
Little things affect little minds
Success is the child of audacity
All for one and one for all
Creativity is contagious pass it on
Most fools think they are only ignorant
There is no better friend than a book
Never confuse movement with action
Rules are not necessarily sacred principles are
All that glitters is not gold
True friends stab you in the front
