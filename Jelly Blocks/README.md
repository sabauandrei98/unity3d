# Jelly Blocks
Jelly Blocks is an extended version of what should have been a simple homework. The project was initially a console based C++ program and then, it was written in C#, Unity.

This is a turn based board game. The goal of the game is to let the opponent without moves.
The game can be played:
<h3>1 vs 1</h3> 
<h3>1 vs AI</h3>

Each turn, the player chooses a empty square. This square will be covered with a 3x3 bigger square colored in a specific color representing the Player or the AI. 
After some turn, there will be no place left on the table. The one who made the last move wins.

The biggest challenge was the AI. To build and unbeatable AI, you have to think like the player and the player has a lot of strategies.
The AI thinking is build on a list of particular cases and a popular algorithm, Monte Carlo Tree Search.
