# Omid
Omid is a project that came to life about an year ago when taking some courses about exponential functions. 
The game was developed by putting together small pieces of work, the whole process took around one month.

Omid is a 2D mobile game having as a main character an caterpillar.  
The game inherits the idea from the well known game Flappy Bird, relying on fancy effects, awesome skins and a not easy to beat drunk mode. 
The player controls the main character, attempting to fly between columns of pipes without hitting them. 
The more pipes player avoids, the more points are earned. 
These points come under leaves form and allows player to buy skins, changing the main character color and effects.
