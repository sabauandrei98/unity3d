# Useless Game

This game was created in order to test the Mobile Ads. It is not that special, this is why I call it Useless Game.
To complete the game you have to get points in order to buy all the letters. To get points you can watch an Interstitial or Video Ad, or tap the first button which gives you only 1 point.
