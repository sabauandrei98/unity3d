# Egyptus

Egyptus is a simple but not so easy game. The game is played in turns. Each turn the player receives a combination of arrows. 
The player has to say if the model is correct by selecting the green gem for "YES" and red gem for "NO".
To make things even harder, the arrows are moving, making it trickier to observe the pattern.
