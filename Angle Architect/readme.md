# Angle Architect

This is a game in which the player has to draw angles. Each turn a certain number of degrees is shown on the screen and the player has to draw the coresponding angle.
The player has 50 points of life meaning that if the angle to draw is 150 and the player draws an 175 angle, the life will decrease by 25.
